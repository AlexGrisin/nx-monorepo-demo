# Functional E2E Testing

Functional end-to-end (E2E) testing ensures that all application features work as expected from a user perspective. Playwright is used to automate real browser interactions, verifying that all components and flows function correctly in an environment that closely mirrors production.

## Modular Microfrontend-Level Integration Testing

Modern frontend architectures often use microfrontendsâ€”individually deployable modules that together form the complete application. To ensure quality and agility, E2E testing is performed at both the microfrontend and cross-module levels.

### What

Validate end-to-end functionality at the level of individually deployable microfrontends.

### How

- Implement a decoupled testing strategy that mirrors the architecture of distributed frontend systems.
- Execute E2E tests against isolated microfrontend modules, using contract-based boundaries to ensure each module meets its integration requirements.
- Enable integration testing for cross-module flows by orchestrating interactions between microfrontends in a controlled environment.

### Benefit

- Improves test reliability and speeds up execution by reducing dependencies between modules.
- Reduces coupling between teams by aligning test ownership with deployment units.
- Enables E2E quality gates per microfrontend, supporting safe, independent releases and rapid delivery.
